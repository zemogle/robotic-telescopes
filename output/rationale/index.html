    <div class="content">
    <p>This Focus Meeting concentrates on the capacity and feasibility to build networks of
remote/robotic telescopes for educational use at undergraduate and high school level (last
years). Access to remote/robotic telescopes will contribute in building a critical mass of
astronomers, but most importantly, it will contribute to STEM education.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to enhance the scientific capacity of Global South countries. Performing
research-oriented, observation-based hands-on projects using remote/robotic telescopes
allows young students to maintain and raise their interest in STEM-oriented disciplines.
An inventory of the worldwide capacity of telescopes for such purpose, the content of the
project and a thorough discussion of the opportunities in offering network facilities to
universities in need, can mean an important step towards that higher mentioned goal.</p>
<h2>I - The present situation</h2>
<p>The desired outcomes of this session are:</p>
<ol>
<li>A comprehensive overview of important robotic/remote networks available for education as
well as the conditions for their use. We foresee that an inventory is prepared before the
meeting.</li>
<li>Which remote/robotic telescopes are specifically used, at what frequency, for what
educational purpose at the universities?</li>
<li>What are the results obtained by the universities and high schools where such hands-on
activities are developed, with a focus on the Global South world? How have the Tutors and
Instructors been trained? Other lessons that other can learn from?</li>
</ol>
<h3>Proposed invited talks:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ramasamy Venugopal and Kevin Govender (OAD, South Africa): an overview of the use of
remote/robotic telescopes through the OAD applications: purposes and public.</li>
<li>Edward Gomez (Las Cumbres Observatory, Cardiff, UK): an overview of the use
of telescope time granted for education at LCO: purposes and public.</li>
<li>Myriam Pajuelo (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú): an example of use
remote/robotic telescopes for undergrads at the PUCP, Lima, Peru.</li>
</ul>
<h2>II - The future:</h2>
<p>The desired outcomes of this session are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discussion on the stimulating power of observational projects for student at undergraduate
level. How can it be adapted to a University Curriculum taking into account the variety of
university teaching policies?</li>
<li>Evaluation of the need of access to remote/robotic telescopes, with a focus on the African
continent.</li>
<li>The availability of the faculty members to develop such hands-on activities. Tutor trainings
needed for such teaching.</li>
<li>New networks of remote/robotic telescopes that may emerge from collaborations between
observatories already existing in several African countries amongst others. How to provide an
access, at no-cost, to remote/robotic telescopes for the Global South countries?</li>
<li>The use and sharing of databases stored in the different observatories of the network.</li>
<li>Concluding: Round Table Discussion</li>
</ol>
<h3>Proposed invited talks</h3>
<ul>
<li>Kshitij Thorat (University of Pretoria, South Africa): An example of use remote/robotic
telescopes for undergraduate students at the university of Pretoria: Student response and
possible improvements.</li>
<li>Thulani Jili (University of Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa): Hands-on activity at the
university with remote/robotic telescopes: needs and possibilities.</li>
<li>Abdelmajid Benhida (Cadi Ayyad university, Marrakech, Morocco): the Oukmaiden
observatory in Morocco with robotic telescopes. From its use how to create a network of
remote/robotic telescopes in Africa? The partners of such a project and its funding</li>
